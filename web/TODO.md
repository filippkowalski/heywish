# HeyWish Web TODO

- Integrate Firebase auth flow so the web app mirrors mobile sign-in and onboarding steps.
- Surface private and friends-only wishlists on profile pages after verifying viewer permissions.
- Implement wishlist management screens (create, edit, reserve) with live backend wiring.
- Add Playwright smoke tests for profile rendering and wish reservation journeys.
- Consolidate on a single package manager (pnpm vs npm) to resolve dual-lockfile warnings in builds.

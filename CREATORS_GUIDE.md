### 🏁 Getting Started

Make a new TikTok and IG account. We recommend using handles like:
- `@*your_name*.wishlist`
- `@*your_name*.gifting`
- `@*your_name*.lifestyle`

Put something like this in your bio:
"✨ Gift inspo & wishlist ideas
📲 I use Jinnie for all my wishlists
🎁 Make gift-giving magical"

**1. Don't post immediately. Spend 2–3 days warming it up.**

**2. Watch content about gift-giving, birthdays, lifestyle, organization — like/comment/follow relevant accounts naturally.**

**3. Once your FYP/Explore is lifestyle & gift-centered, you're ready.**

> Tip: Engage with relevant content for 10-15 minutes daily. When most of your Explore/FYP serves you lifestyle, organization, and gift-giving content, wait a day, and check again. If it's consistent, your account is primed for posting.

**This helps the algorithm understand your niche and target audience.**

**4. Create a sample video and send it to us for approval before posting.**

We'll make sure it aligns with our brand guidelines. Once approved, you can post.

For the first 3 days, post 1x daily, then increase to 2x daily.

### **✅ Editing & Posting Guidelines**

- Film with **good lighting** — natural window light or ring light works best
- Use **aesthetic backgrounds** — clean bedroom, vanity setup, or minimal cafe vibes
- **Engage 5-10 mins before & after** posting to signal activity to the algorithm
- Use [**trending sounds**](https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/popular/music/pc/en) relevant to lifestyle/organization/relationships
- Space posts **at least 3-4 hours apart** — no rapid-fire posting
- Do not use view bots or paid promotion without approval
- **Edit videos in safe zone format** (avoid text/faces in top 15% and bottom 20%)
